Technical questions:

- setCommandContext
- namespaces (commands, schemas)
- read in more detail about vscode url schema (should schema have the form of "name://"?)

Todos:

- get manual edited lines of merge Result for matching it up with `StateManager.conflict`

- readme + demo gif
- minify code as pre-publish
- show next conflict (in overview lane as well)
- sync scrolling
- vscode.setEditorLayout for setting 3 way and restoring old on close
- add dismiss option
- handle resolve-conflict cmd when not in merge-conflict state
- check for cross-os usage of "\n" symbol
